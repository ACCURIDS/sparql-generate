<p>SPARQL-Generate queries may be modularized. Embedded <tt>GENERATE</tt> templates may consist of a call to an external URI-identified SPARQL-Generate query, passing arguments to its declared parameters.</p>

<p>The example below is a modularized version of example <tt>06-DifferentSources</tt>. The main query calls an external SPARQL-Generate query that generates RDF for the two next events occurring within a 20 miles range of a specific location.</p>
