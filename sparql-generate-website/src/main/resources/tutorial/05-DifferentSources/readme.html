<p>Here, we combine the data about the measuring stations (in JSON) with 
data from a Web service for finding events (in XML). The locations of 
the stations are used as a parameter in the web service call. We ask for 
all events that will happen around the geopoint of the stations in a 20 
miles radius. In this case, we do access the actual service on the Web.</p>
